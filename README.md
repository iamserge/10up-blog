# 10up Technical excercise

## Notes

In order to start the app in dev mode:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

In order to initiate production build using Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Jest unit tests

```bash
npm run test
```

## Implementation

I have decided to use Next.js as a framework, as it has SSR support and solves a lot of problems when building multi-page React apps. For tests I use Jest with Enzyme, and SASS for styling.
